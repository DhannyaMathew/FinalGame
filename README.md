Bugs to be aware of:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General

When going through a door, you may fall between rooms
Cause: Not too sure- possibly due to a lags
Fix: Press "R" to go to the actual start off the level

Restarting levels by pressing R does not reset the interactables. 
This is apparent in the key interaction and mirror picking up and shooting. If you wish to undo an action with an interactable,
 it cannot be solved by the reset button and you will have to restart the game by pressing ESC and then MENU and then QUIT

The settings in the settings menu do not yet work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transition 1

There is a lag spike when you look back at level 1 through the door in Transition 1. 
Cause: Not sure 
Fix: Press "R" and don't look back.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 2

Restarting level sometimes breaks chain
Cause: A spike in the force/environmental change causes the links to break
Fix: Restart game. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There may be serious lagging.
Cause: COuld be lots of particles or the same issue as transition 1.
Fix: Restart Game. Plug in computer if it is not already plugged in.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Camera through exit door doesn't behave correctly.
Cause: Could not find a conclusive cause.
Fix: Just walk through the exit door.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transition 2

No noticeable bugs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 4

Placing of mirrors is not yet perfect. The mirror will be placed where you aim (aiming from the middle of the screen). 
This may result in the mirror not being placed exactly where you thought. 
Cause: No aim UI yet
Fix: Walk up to the mirror and press E to pick it up again.

Walking up ladders in level 4 doesn't properly
Cause: ladders have not yet been set up properly yet
Fix: try moving forward (Press 'W') while facing the stairs at a 45 degree angle. Or try walk up the wall. If you get stuck, press R.
